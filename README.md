# autoenum
Hello everyone!

This is my first real python script I've worked on and with the help of CGPT I was able to get a working auto enumeration tool.

I created this with the intention of speeding up my HTB enumerations so it's not the most advanced thing ever 
but it speeds up my workflow.

With one command you get a nikto, nmap, and gobuster terminal all working on the IP addres you provide to it!

_**Make sure you have gnome-terminal and python installed!!**_


<h1>Instructions</h1>
&nbsp;
<p>1. In your terminal type <code>git clone https://github.com/darksixty/autoenum</code>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>2. Type <code>cd autoenum</code>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<p>3. Run the script using <code>python main.py</code>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>4. 3 terminals should spawn and begin enumeration!&nbsp;</p>

Let me know if you have any questions!
