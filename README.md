# autoenum
Starts Nikto, gobuster, and nmap enumeration all at once on an IP address you provide.

Hello everyone!

This is my first real python script I've worked on and with the help of CGPT I was able to get a working auto enumeration tool.

I created this with the intention of speeding up my HTB enumerations so it's not the most advanced thing ever 
but it speeds up my workflow.

_**Make sure you have gnome-terminal installed!!**_

Let me know if you have any questions!
